      "Slate is a very distinguishable character. His most prominent features are his tall stature (the official Jet Set RadioÂ Guidebook states that he is 6 feet tall) and oblong nose (resembling the famous graffiti character Kilroy). He is virtually bald, save for what look like three brown braids that stick straight up from the very top of his head. He wears an orange jacket with a high collar that masks the lower half of his face, and goggles on his forehead. He has gray pants with lighter stripes, matching striped gloves, and blue skates with yellow wheels.",
