Easily consume Jet Set Radio data into your applications! This API includes data from both JSR and JSRF. This service is connected to [JetSetRadio-API-Admin](https://github.com/Jet-Set-Radio-API/JetSetRadio-API-Admin) which is an ETL service that manages the data this application uses.


## Purpose
This application is meant to be a service anyone can use to call and get data relating to anything from the JetSetRadio universe. 


## Overview
This is an open-source software free for anyone to use. I do NOT claim to own.
