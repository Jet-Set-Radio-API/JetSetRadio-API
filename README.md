Easily consume Jet Set Radio data into your applications! This API includes data from both JSR and JSRF. This service is dependent on [JetSetRadio-API-Admin](https://github.com/Jet-Set-Radio-API/JetSetRadio-API-Admin) which is an ETL service that manages the data this application uses.


## Purpose
This application is meant to be a service anyone can use to call and get data relating to anything from the JetSetRadio universe. 


## Overview
This is an open-source software free for anyone to use. I do NOT claim to own.
 *NOTE: I do NOT own JetSetRadio, JetSetRadioFuture, or any entity falling under the JetSetRadio franchise. I do not own the name Jet-Set-Radio-API. I do not own any of the content provided by this API.


## How To Run
See these [instructions](/src/docs/DEV_SETUP.md) on how to set up a development environment.
The only dependency this project has is a mongo database.
